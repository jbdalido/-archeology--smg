# BUILD

Thebuild process is gonna change with the deletion of deploy. Instead we'll 
just add a hook section to callback anything:

    {
        "image":    "registry/image",
        "tags":     [ "master", "ae4fsdg", "v1.2" ],
        "created":  "123465234523",
        "ExitCode": 0,
        "success":  true,
        "stdOutErr": "blabla"
    }


# Daemon

Daemon will change, it will now be a real daemon builder, with a correct api
